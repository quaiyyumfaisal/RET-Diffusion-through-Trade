# RET Diffusion through Trade
This repository contains data, Stata scripts, and documentation to replicate our study on how import exposure to RET knowledge stock influences renewable energy adoption. It includes main regressions, robustness checks, stratified analyses, and placebo tests. Run the Stata files to reproduce results.

## Replication Steps  
1. **Construct the Dataset:** Run `01_RET-Diffusion-Data.do`
2. **Residual Analysis:** Run `02_RET-Trade-Residual-Charts.do`
3. **Run Main Regression:** Run `02_MainRegression.do`  
4. 

## Outputs
1. **Residual Graphs and Figures** can be found in the [`4_Exhibits`](./4_Exhibits) folder.








*Note*
- In the [`Primary_Datasets`](./Primary_Datasets) folder, the bilateral trade data from UN COMTRADE can be found. However, that dataset has not been utilized in the respective study due to a large number of missing data.
